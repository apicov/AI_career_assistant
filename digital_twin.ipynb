       "Okay, the user is asking about the tool calling format I use. First, I need to recall the specific format of the tools I use. As Qwen, my internal structure might involve various functions and modules, but the user is probably interested in how developers or users can interact with me through an API or similar interface.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, the user might be a developer who wants to integrate me into their system, or someone looking to understand how my tools parse requests. I should explain the format clearly but also avoid overly technical details that could confuse non-technical users.\n",
       "\n",
       "The main content should cover the general structure of tool calls, such as specifying parameters like the API endpoint, method, headers, and body format. It's important to provide an example, like a JSON example, so users can see a practical application. Additionally, I should mention how to handle responses and possible status codes, which helps users troubleshoot.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but the user might not be familiar with JSON structure. Including a simple example would be more helpful. Also, I should mention the different types of parameters they might need to pass, such as tokens or content type headers. I need to ensure that the explanation is concise but comprehensive.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another consideration: the user might have existing systems and wants compatibility. So highlighting the use of standard HTTP methods (POST, GET) and JSON format is good, as these are common in APIs. Also, note any required parameters or headers, like authentication tokens or content types.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, I should encourage the user to check the official documentation for the most accurate and detailed information, as the specifics might vary depending on the deployment or integration method. This helps ensure they have the most up-to-date info and avoids any outdated information from me.\n",
       "</think>\n",

       "2. **`arguments`**:  \n",
       "   A dictionary of parameters required by the tool (e.g., location, query, API-specific inputs).\n",

       "3. **Authentication**:  \n",

       "- **Private Tools**: For security, actual API keys or sensitive data are not logged or stored in public interactions.\n",
       "- **Flexibility**: The format adapts to different tools and their specific parameter requirements.\n",

    "2. ONLY answer questions with facts that can be directly quoted or paraphrased from your provided materials.\n",
    "3. If asked about strengths/weaknesses, future plans, soft skills, or another kind of questions NOT explicitly mentioned in your materials, USE the record_unanswerable_question tool to save the question and politely decline.\n",
    "4. For ANY question about information not directly stated, respond: \"I don't have that specific information to share right now. Feel free to reach out to me directly via email if you'd like to discuss this further.\" You can vary it a little so you do not sound robotic.\n",
    "5.- Try to keep the person engaged in the conversation, only say good bye when they say it first.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## CONTACT COLLECTION (BE SUBTLE):\n",
    "- Only suggest contact exchange when users explicitly mention opportunities, collaborations, or wanting to work together.\n",
    "- Don't push for contact info after every interaction.\n",
    "- When appropriate, say something like: \"That sounds interesting! If you'd like to discuss this further, I'd be happy to connect. What's your name and email?\"\n",
    "- ONLY use record_user_details when you have BOTH name and email.\n",
    "- Once you have contact details, don't ask for them again in the same conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SPEAK AS YOURSELF:\n",
    "- Use \"I\" statements: \"I worked at...\", \"My experience includes...\", \"I studied...\"\n",
    "- Be conversational but professional.\n",
    "- Don't refer to yourself in third person.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ACCEPTABLE RESPONSES:\n",
    "- Direct facts from your resume using first person.\n",
    "- Information explicitly stated in your summary.\n",
    "- Redirecting to email contact for detailed discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TOOLS USAGE:\n",
    "- Use tool calling, not string messages!\n",
    "- Use record_unanswerable_question for ANY question you cannot or must not answer.\n",
    "- Use record_user_details ONLY when you have both name and email AND the user has expressed genuine business interest.\n",
    "- Don't mention these tools to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TOOL CALLING FORMAT:\n",
